Python Script to Capture Camera Images

Libraries:

     OpenCV
     tkinter
Code explanation:

     OpenCV and tkinter libraries are imported.
     Global variables are defined to control the camera and recording state.
     The capture_image function is defined to capture the image from the camera, display it in the window, and save the image if recording is enabled.
     The on_off_camera function is defined to turn the camera on or off.
     The start_stop_recording function is defined to start or stop recording.
     The main window is created with tkinter.
     Buttons are created and configured to call the appropriate functions.
     The capture_image function is called to start capturing images.
     The window is kept open until the user closes it.

Improvements:

     Add options to define image resolution and capture framerate.
     Add the functionality to detect and recognize faces.
     Add the functionality to apply filters and effects to images.
     Save images in a format other than PNG.

Comments:

     This script is a basic example and can be adapted to meet your specific needs.
     Make sure you have installed the OpenCV and tkinter libraries before running the script.
